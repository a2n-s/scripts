* scripts
A collection of scripts for my daily use on ArchLinux.

** Installation
*** on ArchLinux
one can use [[https://github.com/a2n-s/pkgbuilds/blob/main/x86_64/a2n-s-scripts-git/PKGBUILD][my custom PKGBUILD]] as follows:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/a2n-s/pkgbuilds
cd ./pkgbuilds
./install.sh x86_64/a2n-s-scripts-git
#+end_src

*** on another distribution of Linux
/Makefile and instructions *coming soon*/
** Usage
The scripts are installed by default in ~/usr/local/bin/~.

Try running one of them, e.g. ~a2n-s-{script} --help~ to get the help for ~{script}~.
